# Banking System Domain Driven Design

"Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain." - Martin Fowler

This project is an attempt to understand both Object Oriented Programming and the global 
financial and banking system by creating a DDD model of the banking domain. But it is also
an attempt to map different models of banking systems from different eras. 

Eras of banking covered:

Renaissance era bills of exchange / 
National Banking in the US before 1853 / 
Correspondent and Clearinghouse Banking 1853-1913 /
Federal Reserve System 1913-2008 /
QE era FED 2008-present /

The user interface is currently under construction. The core of the program can be found in src/classes
